# Zero-knowledge proof
An example of zero-knowledge proof.

A Zero-knowledge proof is when one party proves something to another party without revealing any of the details of what is being proven. 

I am implementing the proof in [the Zero-knowledge proof Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) entitled [_Two balls and the colour-blind friend_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof#Two_balls_and_the_colour-blind_friend).
